  How much time I should put into this project?
</summary>
  First of all, it is a challenging task to find a fair time that can pay-off for your efforts. PanCanAID includes many components from centers, data owners, clinicians, Bio-medical students help us for collection of data, psychology students help us on patients' follow-up, segmentation contributers (GP and radiologists), data validators, machine learning scientists (master and PhD students, and some times medical students), and our advisorial board members. Each component should work in concordance with other components. My responsibility as founder of this project is to align interest of all members, and compensate their efforts, as far as I can. 
<br><br>
  
  To be honest, segmentation needs expertise and percision, and this would be invaluable for the project and our future users. The only value I can provide to partially compensate your effort is the papers. Again, thank you. Depending on your expertise we have three level of segmentors:
  
  - GP: 80 hour of helping us with segmentations
  - Radiologist: 60 hour of helping us with diagnosis and segmentation
  - Expert Pancreatic Cancer Radiologist: 40 hour of helping us with staging and validation

  You should reach me so I can add you to our **PanCanAID On-Boarding ** Channel in Telegram. You can reach me here: https://t.me/sdamirsa. Here is the summary of segmentation steps:
  
  - Learning Path and Test
    - You should first see the educational videos at www.pancanaid.com/education. Follow either GP or Radiologist pathway.
    - Get one case from PanCanAID telegrom bot.
    - Finish one test case.
    - Send COMPLETION MESSAGE to PanCanAID telegrom bot and notify me.
    - I will evaluate it and provide feedback. After your revision and when you reached our unified standard, you can start your segmentaiont tasks.
  - The Segmentation Task Loop for each case is like this:
    - Get a case from telegrom bot, depending on your assignment including:
      - Your task: Either PDS (for diagnosis) or PAS (for segmentation)
      - Your case type: Either CASE (pancreatic cancer) or CONTROL
    - Do the segmentation

  Why do I get an error when I enter my username and password?
</summary>
  Possible solutions are:
  
  - Check that you enter both username and password with correct uppercase and lowercase letters (both are sensitive).
  - Change your browser and see if the issue is resolved. You cannot enter the server in incognito mode. 
  There have been some reports of errors when using Irancell's internet. Please check your internet connection and try again. 
  - If you enter your username and password incorrectly two times, your account will be locked for an hour. Wait an hour and try again, or contact me to change your password. 
  - If you forgot your password, you should contact me so I can change it for you. 
  
If the issue persists, reach out to me on Telegram.
