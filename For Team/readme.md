  Why do I get an error when I enter my username and password?
</summary>
  Possible solutions are:
  
  - Check that you enter both username and password with correct uppercase and lowercase letters (both are sensitive).
  - Change your browser and see if the issue is resolved. You cannot enter the server in incognito mode. 
  There have been some reports of errors when using Irancell's internet. Please check your internet connection and try again. 
  - If you enter your username and password incorrectly two times, your account will be locked for an hour. Wait an hour and try again, or contact me to change your password. 
  - If you forgot your password, you should contact me so I can change it for you. 
  
If the issue persists, reach out to me on Telegram.
