What is PanCanAID
An artificial intelligence model and associated data bank of CT scan, EUS, and survival of pathologically confirmed pancreas cancer (Pancreas ductal adenocarcinoma and pancreas neuroendocrine tumors) will be collected from seven medical centers. Annotation and manual segmentation will be handled by an expert reviewer and confirmed by a second investigator.
